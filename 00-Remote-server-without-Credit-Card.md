# Day 0 - Creating Your Own Server - without a credit card

## INTRO

We normally recommend using Amazon's AWS "Free Tier" (http://aws.amazon.com) or Digital Ocean (https://digitalocean.com) - but both require that you have a credit card. The same is true of the Microsoft Azure, Google's GCP and the vast majority of providors listed at Low End Box (https://lowendbox.com/).

Some will accept Paypal, or Bitcoin - but typically those who don't have a credit card don't have these either.

Note that many will also require you to be over 18 (but not all), and this is true also of some of the options blow.

WARNING: If you go searching too deeply for options in this area, you're very likely to come across a range scammy, fake or fraudulent sites. While we've tried to eliminate these from the links below, please do be careful! It should go without saying that none of these are "affiliate" links, and we get no kick-backs from any of them :-)

So, if you are in this situation, below are some of your options:

## Free Trail
* https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free - no credit card or student email required, 30 days trail. (VPS service known as Hyper Protect Virtual Server) - trying this one



## Educational packs

Note that:
* This server is now running, and completely exposed to the whole of the Internet
* You alone are responsible for managing it
* You have just installed the latest updates, so it should be secure for now
